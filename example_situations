Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried resetting your password? Okay, let me check some things on my end. Can you please confirm your email address and username for me?
Thanks. Let me take a look at your account. It looks like your account has been locked due to too many unsuccessful login attempts. I'm going to unlock it for you now.No problem, glad I could assist you. Is there anything else I can help you with?


Hi there, can you tell me a bit more about the issue? When did it start happening? Okay, let me take a look at your computer remotely. Can you please download the remote desktop software from our website and run it? Great, can you give me the access code that's displayed on your screen? I need that to connect to your computer. It looks like there are some malware and adware programs on your computer that are slowing it down. I'm going to remove them for you now.
